<h1><strong>Water</strong></h1>
    <p>This webpage will cover drinking water, water powered electricity and ocean water.</p>
    <h1>Drinking water</h1>
    <p>Water is one of the three most important things in survival. Did you know that the average human can survive three weeks without food but only three days
       without water isn't that shocking! I going to explain a few reasons why you need to drink water.</p>
    
    <h2>Reason1: Saliva</h2>
    
    <p>I klnow you are probaly thinking gross! But wait Saliva can actually be quite usefull. Here are four uses...</p>
    <ol>
        <li>It helps you swallow and break down food.
        <li>Keeps your mouth moist and comfortable.
        <li>Fights germs in your mouth.
        <li>and helps prevent bad breath.
    </ol>
    <h2>Reason 2: regulates body temperatures</h2>
    
    <p>Body temperature is vital as it rises to high or plummets to low it might be a sign that you have a fever or cold and if it becomes a super serious problem
        you could fall very ill and possibly die.</p>
    
    <h2>Reason 3: Mood</h2>
    <p>If you don't stay hydrated you will start to have mood swings where you start to feel a bit confused and anxious might get grumpy</p>
    
    <h2>Reason 4:  Constipation</h2>
    <p>Drinking water is another way to stop constipation as well as eating fiber. Also drinking carbonated or plain water helps ease the pain if you have
        constipation.</p>
    
    <h1>Water powered electricity</h1>
    <p>Water powered electricity is a source of renewable energy which means it can never end and carrie on going.</p>
